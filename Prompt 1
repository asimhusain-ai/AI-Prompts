#Generate a statue image of your real image !

Create a giant hyper-realistic statue based on the given photo, keeping the original face exactly the same without changes. The statue stands tall in the middle of a roundabout in Dhaka, near a famous historical landmark. The statue is still under construction, surrounded by scaffolding, with many construction workers in yellow helmets and orange vests climbing, welding, and working on it. Parts of the statueâ€™s body are still exposed metal framework, while other sections are already detailed and finished. The background shows the realistic atmosphere of VARANASI CITY: crowded streets with colorful rickshaws, packed buses, and small cars circling the roundabout. Street vendors with tea stalls, fruit carts, and colorful umbrellas line the roadside. Shop signs, big billboards, and messy hanging electric wires crisscross above the streets, creating the typical Dhaka city vibe. The bright daytime sky shines above, with tropical trees and a bustling, lively atmosphere. Style: photorealistic, vibrant, and full of life.
